                <h2>To My Future Beloved Wife</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="letter-body">
                <p>This letter may make you want to shed some tears or make you full of enjoy and laugher. Let me take you to the land of love which I call Saint Travis Francis!!🎇</p>
                <p>I know we have been in a little hit for the pass week, but I want to take today and forevermore days, weeks, months, years, quarter century, half century and many moree centuries til we die, to show how much I love you, I appreciate you, adore you, admire you,…. oh wooow, how can I forget my secret admirer, fat fat pretty kitty how much I love her and sucking her soul out too, (Muhmuh how you mean I had to bring her up 😏) when I see her later tonight in that bedroom, I have to call her, "coochie coochie coochie, coochieeeee… where are youuuuuu??🧏🏽‍♂️" Been missing you my little chunky baby come here to daddy🥰!</p>
                <p>FOCUS! Now back to being in love you baby, so I want to take time today to let you know I really love you, I want things to work out with us, even if it takes us a while to get where we want to be in life, build something together, build a bright future(I know you not Bob the builder chill 🤣)……… But to achieve that please understand me think deep and put yourself in my shoes babe. hear me out:</p>
                <p>"I hate an argument or fight, would you like to be the only one showing love or I asking you to do certain things, when you do it you don't get it back? No, you won't like that (well in my opinion). All I want is for my wife to be all about me, affectionate, speak to me in a respectful manner and not shout and being all arrogant for little or even big situations, speak in love not like someone you just like, talk to me like you in love and if you think you doing it already I feel like you need to show it more and way more often." If that happens, we will be moving way better off than before.</p>
                <p>"JAHHHHHH I REALLY LOVE YOUUUUU" *Holding my hair tightly* looking at you through that 16 pro camera furiously telling you bro. Not bro but bro😭. I mean, "BABE"🤤. I type that emoji there and it just happened that I start reminiscing how my tongue was swirling around your clit between them thick thighs since the last time of doing you😖.</p>
                <p>Tonight THERE?! It's the beginning of your birthday as I present to you, A wonderful, memorable, well thought out bouquet of flowers 💐!! This bouquet is my initial gift to you babe. Not only a birthday gift, but to show you how I? ……. Continue it……..YES.. How much I love you! Tonight, I just want to grip your thick body upon mine, skin to skin making out, stretching out tongue and not forgetting, kitty kitty💆🏽‍♂️🤤…</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy and appreciate my love towards you babe. "They can't replace you. Ah one Alexa"</p>
                <p>Happy birthday in advance babe!<br>I love you in all type of ways babyyy!</p>
